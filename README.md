Assignment:

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Create the Earthquake Visualization

Get your dataset from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
I selected to pull all earthquake data from the preceding 24 hours https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson

Use leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes based on longitude and latitude with markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size and depth of the earthqauke by color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when the associated marker is clicked

Create a legend that will provide context for the data
